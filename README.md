# CoDecode
My first python project. 

First created on: 03.05.2023, when I was learning python from Code With Harry.
"Most advanced code I have made to date!!!! 03/05/2023 (Took a good 5 hours(one hour to make, 4 hours to correct the bugs))
If the string has 3 characters or less, the string is reversed. If it has more than 3, then the first letter of the string is shifted to the last place and three random characters are appended at the beginning and end of the string."

Recently went through the code and realised that it was just TERRIBLE. Redid some things, refined the code.
